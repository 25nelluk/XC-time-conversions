This program calculates times, paces, and distances based on what the user inputs. 
For example, if the user wants to find the time by inputting the pace and distance, the program will calculate the time using that information.

The program was created so that I could figure out Cross Country times/paces/distances while planning out workouts.
Currently a WIP as some times do not format properly and some parts of the code could flow smoother.
