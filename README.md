This program calculates times, paces, distances, average times, and spreads based on what the user inputs. 
For example, if the user wants to find the time by inputting the pace and distance, the program will calculate the time using that information.

"Cross Country Time Convertor Program" is the updated version of the program.

The program was created so that I could figure out Cross Country times/paces/distances while planning out workouts.
Currently a WIP.
